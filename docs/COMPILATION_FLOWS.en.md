# ⚙️ Professional Compilation Flows

This guide details the two recommended workflows to generate the final executable for the **Chromium Auditor Suite**, covering both hybrid and pure Linux/WSL environments.

---

## 🏗️ Flow A: Hybrid (Windows + WSL/Linux)
**Recommended for: Maximum stability and ease of use.**

This flow uses Windows for the heavy compilation lifting (where native APIs are present) and WSL/Linux for the security and stealth phase (digital signing).

### 1. Preparation on Windows (PowerShell)
Install the necessary dependencies:
```powershell
pip install pyarmor pyinstaller -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Binary Compilation (Windows)
Generate the obfuscated and packaged `.exe`:
```powershell
pyarmor pack -e " --onefile --noconsole --name 'ChromiumAuditor' " main.py
```
*The result will be in `dist/ChromiumAuditor.exe`.*

### 3. Digital Signing (WSL/Linux)
Copy the file to your WSL environment and run the certification script:
```bash
bash autocert.sh dist/ChromiumAuditor.exe "YourSecurePassword"
```

## 🏗️ Flow B: Pure (WSL/Linux with Wine)
**Recommended for: Pentesting from isolated environments or distributions like Kali Linux.**

This flow allows generating a Windows executable without leaving Linux, emulating the Windows environment using Wine.

### 1. Wine Prefix Setup
Create a clean 64-bit environment to avoid conflicts:
```bash
export WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.wine_chromium
export WINEARCH=win64
winecfg  # Ensure the Windows version is set to 'Windows 10'
```

### 2. Installing Python for Windows in Wine
Download the official Windows installer (`python-3.x-amd64.exe`) from python.org and run it:
```bash
wine python-3.11.x-amd64.exe /quiet InstallAllUsers=1 PrependPath=1
```

### 3. Installing Dependencies inside Wine
Use the emulated `pip` to install the Windows libraries:
```bash
wine python -m pip install --upgrade pip
wine python -m pip install pycryptodomex pywin32 requests pyarmor pyinstaller
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If `pywin32` fails, run this post-installation command:
> `wine python Scripts/pywin32_postinstall.py -install`

### 4. Metamorphic Compilation
Run the full process under Wine:
```bash
wine python ofuscator.py main.py
wine python -m pyarmor pack -e " --onefile --noconsole --name 'ChromiumAuditor' " main.py
```

### 5. In-Situ Signing
Sign the binary directly from your Linux terminal:
```bash
bash autocert.sh dist/ChromiumAuditor.exe
```

## 🛡️ Flow Comparison

| Feature | Flow A (Hybrid) | Flow B (Wine) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stability** | ⭐ Excellent | ⚠️ Moderate |
| **Simplicity** | ⭐ High | ⚠️ Low (Complex setup) |
| **Isolation** | ❌ Low | ⭐ High (All in Linux) |
| **Build Size** | ~18 MB | ~18 MB |

## ⚖️ Pentesting Recommendation
If you are operating from an attack machine (Kali Linux), **Flow B** allows you to keep your entire supply chain within Linux, minimizing the exposure of your development tools on Windows systems that might be monitored.
